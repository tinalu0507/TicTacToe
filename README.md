# TicTacToe
This project features a bigger version of the all-time-classic game tic tac toe. Instead of only one square of tic-tac-toe, the game now has nine squares of tic-tac-toe in a big square. The player must win three small tic-tac-toes in order to win the whole round. The game has 5 rounds in total, and can be played by two players. Whoever wins 3 rounds first get to win the tournament.
This is a project that I completed during my java class by using the java swing framework. It was a fun experience to learn java swing and create the user interface for the project.
